# AI Book Generator - Complete Web Application

## Overview

I have successfully built a complete web application for AI book generation service based on your existing React/Next.js framework. The application includes:

### Backend (Flask)
- RESTful API with CORS enabled
- Background job processing with threading
- In-memory status tracking (can be upgraded to Redis/database)
- Custom DOCX generation without external dependencies
- File storage and download endpoints

## Features Implemented
